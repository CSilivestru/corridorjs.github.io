      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>On the third Thursday of every month, the local JavaScript community gets together for a day to hang out and talk shop.</p>

      <p>The main event is CorridorJS, which starts at 7pm and includes community-curated lightning talks with musical interludes. Admission is $10 and comes with a ticket which can optionally be redeemed for a craft beer, wine, or soda</p>

      <p>CorridorJS was started by <a href="https://twitter.com/gordtanner">Gord Tanner</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexkinsella">Alex Kinsella</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosperez">Carlos Perez</a>. This meetup was modeled after and
      inspired by <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/">BrooklynJS</a></p>
